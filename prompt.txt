You are asked to come up with a set of 10 diverse task instructions on finding x and y intercepts along with their corresponding Wolfram Alpha query.

Here are the requirements:
1. The instructions should be 1 sentence long.
2. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.
3. Do not generate classification tasks. For example, do not generate tasks such as "Does f(x)=2x have any 0 intercepts?"
4. The problems should be written in natural language with numbers and operations spelled out.
5. Do not use the word 'graph' in your query; instead use commands like 'solve' or 'find'.
6. When writing a query for a word problem, only include the necessary equation to solve the problem.
7. Do not include more than one task in your instruction. For example, do not ask for both X and Y intercepts within the same instruction. 
8. Do not use units from the word problem in the query.
9. The output must be a valid Wolfram Alpha query.
